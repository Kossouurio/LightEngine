## Plant Vs Zombie
- No Images

Made with a State Machine

## Things To ADD And CORRECT 
- A DeltaTime on the "OnColiding" for the Plante.cpp
- Stop Zombie's movement "OnColiding" in Zombie.cpp
- Put the Zombies Vectors in Zombie class to have an easier access in the Scene, and to make easier the suppression of Zombies in the corresponding Vector 
- If possible, try to regroup Zombie's Vector instead of HARDCODE IT
